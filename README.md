# eu.5ginFIRE.riftioyangschema2java

This project contains the OSM API model in Java, based on the RIFT.IO YANG model.
The Java objects were automatically created with `mvn generate-sources` into target/generated-sources and then copied to src/main/java.

WARNING:
The code is enhanced with JSON annotations and other functionally in order to be properly parsed. This is work in progress since there are a lot of objects to be annotated as needed.  
Therefore any future changes to YANG model should be carefuly migrated.
